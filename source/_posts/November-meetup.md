#### Where?

QBurst, Tejomaya, Infopark, Cochin.

Our second KeralaJS meetup will be held at Infopark, Cochin on November 17th (Sunday). This time we've made this event bit bigger by combining with Ruby developers (K-RUG) meetup. Event will start at 9:30 AM and with JavaScript sessions till 1:00 PM. We'll kick off the K-RUG meetup at 2:00 PM, where we have bunch of interesting sessions on Ruby.

This will be a great opportunity for developers working on both platform to interact each other and share their experiences. You can RSVP for both JavaScript and Ruby events separately, but it's highly encouraged to attend both.
