We had our third meetup of KeralaJS on 26th January 2014 at [Cochin HackerSpace](http://hackerspace.aisat.ac.in/). There were 14 attendees, including 5 students.

This time we had mainly 2 sessions. [Praseed Pai](http://praseedp.blogspot.in/) talked about “Comparative analysis of conventional programming languages and JavaScript” where he discussed about the difference between [JavaScript and other languages](http://praseedp.blogspot.in/2014/01/passing-function-as-parameter-in.html) and also the concept prototypical inheritance. Then we took a break for networking and came back for another talk on [Setup Node.js development environment and debugging](http://blog.revathskumar.com/2014/01/setup-nodejs-environment.html) by [Revath S Kumar](http://blog.revathskumar.com/).

Then was a really interesting flash talk on [Android Accelerometer controlled bot](http://psbots.blogspot.in/2014/01/open-web-and-open-hardware-android.html) via WebSockets by [Praveen Sridhar](https://plus.google.com/116698120041390337056/about).

It was a refreshing experience and we want to keep it going. See you all on next meetup!
